# CS229_Machine_learning
Mini-projects involved in the course
1) CalcGPT
    AIM: To disrupt the calculator industry using GPT. Instead of old-fashioned custom-built algorithms for computing answers to arithmetic problems, a system is designed and tested that uses a pre-trained LLM to solve these problems.
2) Vision & uncertainty
     Aim: To measure uncertainty through various methods like calculating ECE values.
3) Deep Ensembles & Covariate Shift
     Aim: To improve the generalization of the final model outputs through Deep Ensembles and covariate Shift using multiple strategies like Mixup augmentation, Stochastic Weight Averaging, and Monte Carlo - Dropout.
